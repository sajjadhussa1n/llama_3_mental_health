It's important to give yourself time and permission to feel all the emotions that come with loss. Seek support from friends or a therapist, who can offer understanding and guidance. Join a grief support group to connect with others who have experienced similar loss. Try to maintain healthy habits, such as exercise and a balanced diet. Finally, find ways to honor and remember your loved one, such as creating a memorial or doing something in their memory.\n","Model's answer: \n","Grief is a natural and normal process, and it's important to allow yourself to feel your emotions. We can work on developing coping strategies, such as talking about your feelings or engaging in self-care activities, to help you process your grief and move on.
